# Introduction: #

Using python and data science our purpose at this work is to compare two of UFRN's courses: BTI and CET.

Both courses have a similar structure, are in the technological field and have heavy financial investiments per year. For these reasons our study tries to show similarities and differences in specifics fiels:

   - Status of students
   - Scores in equivalent disciplines
   - Department expenses
   - Number of students in each department
   - Amount expend per student
   - Amount expent at IMD per graduate students and technical students
   - Courses expenses

By using UFRN's open data , we were capable to get the necessary datasets containing the information used to our analysis.

# Technologies used: #

- Anaconda Navigator;
- Jupter Notebook;
- Python 3.6.

## Python Libraries ##

- Pandas;
- Matplotlib;
- Numpy;
- Seaborn.

# Motivation: #

Our motivation for this work was to try to kill curiosity about the IMD and ECT departments of UFRN, since the number of students between the courses of both departments is quite dissimilar. For this we perform two comparatives: comparative between the students of the BTI course and the CET course of both departments; And comparative between the expenses of each department. After that, we were able to discover a lot of interesting and even surprising data.
